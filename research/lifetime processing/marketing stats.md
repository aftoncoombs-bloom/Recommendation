# What percent of donation page traffic came from a mobile device?

Not sure if this is relevant but it is my understanding that since the iPad OS update in late 2019 the iPad version of Safari reports itself as a desktop browser so iPad traffic is reported as "desktop" rather than "tablet".

# Virtual campaigns

_for security reasons we don't export names (form or organization) via API so I can only get form titles from the form download feature in the control panel. this doesn't include form ID's so I can't tie those back to other things (form type, transactions, etc.). need to get with product to see if we can have form ID added to this download, then wait for the push, re-export, etc._
