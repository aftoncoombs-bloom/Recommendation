1. ~what features have the strongest correlation to performance? positive and negative?~
2. ~what donor facing feature updates correlate to increased performance?~
    1. ~is setting up a feature once sufficient or does repeat visits (by timframe) correlate to increased performance?~
    2. if updates correlate to a change in performance, is there a window of time within which this change existed or did it persist? ie, do donors grow accustomed to changes thus minimizing the effect?
2. ~what is the impact of updating the CMS on form performance?~
    1. ~is there a threshold of page views that ties to stronger performance?~
    2. ~is the correlation related to ongoing visits or a single (by timeframe) update sufficient?~
    3. ~how much is it worth to the form to do it once? how much is it worth to maintain this (ongoing visits)?~
3. ~can reporting engagement be shown to be a cause of performance increase?~
    1. ~is there an increase in fundraising following an increase in reporting engagements?~
    2. ~is there a specific segment of the reporting system that correlates strongest with performance?~
    3. ~are org's that spend more time managing donors (donors, recurring, etc.) shown to increase fundraising following the increase in time managing donors?~
    4. ~do org's tend to engage with reporting on an ongoing basis or for isolated timeframes?~
4. ~do org's that customize receipts experience greater engagement?~
5. do auction promo's correlate to greater performance?
    1. does an increase in engagement balance out the potential loss of funds by discounts?
    2. do they experience a greater number of lower value bids on average?
6. ~do goals (thermometers) drive greater fundraising?~
    1. does fundraising increase as the funds raised approaches the goal?
    2. does adding goals early cause funds to be raised faster than funds are raised when goals are introduced later?
7. do bidders tend to focus on individual items or spread their bids around to various items?
    1. we want to look for evidence to determine if bidders are spreading funds throughout an auction or are they genuinely trying to win specific items
    2. do bidders generally only bid on a single item?
    3. if bidders bid on multiple items, do they tend to bid the same amount?
    4. if bidders bid on multiple items, will bidders increase bids markedly when they have lost on another item?
    5. do bids per item increase with the decrease in items available to bid on?
8. ~does a store cannibilize donations from p2p events?~
    ~1. does the average donation count or volume change when a p2p event has a store?~
    ~2. do donations rise after a store has run out of inventory?~
9. do promo codes cannibilize registrations volume from p2p events?
    1. do registration count increase with the introduction of promos?
    2. does the average registration volume decrease with the introduction of promos?
    3. is the average funds raised by a given participant overcome potential loss of revenue from registrations when promo codes are used?
10. ~do orgs that run more reports raise more funds?~
    1. ~can we establish an increase in engagement with reporting as a precursor to an increase in funds raised?~
    2. ~are there particular aspects of reporting (integrations, donor or recurring edits, custom reports, etc.) that correlate with performance more than others?~
    3. ~which reporting functions are the highest earning org's using the most (constistently)?~
11. do automated integrations increase retension greater than manual integrations?
12. do events that invest time into managing their walk through have better performing participants/teams?
13. does an individual donor tend to give less or more when using gift assist?
14. does an individual donor tend to give less or more when using matching gifts?
15. is there a sweet spot of bid increment that drives greater engagement?
    1. a $1k item with a $50 increment do better than a $1 increment
    2. does that sacrifice the middle ground (ie, sub-$50 increments)
    3. optimal bid increment that drives engagement and bids based on starting price
16. ~gift assist adoption & utilization~
17. ~user activity ditribution~
    1. ~is there one user per org that is responsible for most the activity?~
    2. ~do active users tend to remain active or is this a mantle that is passed between users within the org for given timeframe?~
