# New Client Revenue Report

## Business objective

How much more do clients raise on Qgiv and why? Draw statistically significant conclusions about (1) how much clients raise relative to prior platforms and (2) why is there a difference.

## Completion

- Quantify fundraising difference after implementing Qgiv
- Find statistically significant reasons that could account for these differences
- Quantify critical weaknesses relative to specific competitors, and/or how do their clients perform after joining Qgiv
- Report to marketing 

## Milestones

- Identify data sources (2 weeks)
- Internal performance metrics review & external data integration (1 week)
- Quantify differences for specific competitors (1 week)
- Find the Why (2 weeks)

## Conclusion

### Brief

Inconsistent data within the sources proved continued work on this to not be a valuable use of time.

### Explanation

We identified 3 sources for the necessary data, all of which appeared to be legitimate and provided by seemingly reliable sources. The data was provided via different formats and means of access, some of which were rate limited APIs, so it was necessary extract the data and merge into a consistant format. This required a timed script so as to not violate terms of service. After building the initial data set, we built out an extended data set recording organization start dates and aggregating annualized funds raised before and after joining Qgiv. 

It was at this stage that we began to evaluate the average differences between pre-Qgiv and post-Qgiv revenue which revealed incredible differences, such as average annual revenue of several million pre-Qgiv and average annual revenue of hundreds of thousands post-Qgiv. When the data was compared across the data sources, we found that organizations appearing in multiple data sets had drastically differing data. Comparing the data to our transaction processing data, we could not identify any with consistent relationships across multiple years for the majority of organizations so we were unable to identify a canonical data source for revenue. 

Given the data was proven to be unreliable and no individual data source could be identified as more reliable than another, we were unable to justify continued work.
